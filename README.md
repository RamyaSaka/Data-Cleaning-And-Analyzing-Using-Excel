# Data-Cleaning-using-Excel


In this Project we are importing dataset containing information about the fleet of vehicles. The data is in comma-separated value (CSV) format. The data is cleaned up to run any kind of analysis on it.


**Tasks performed:**

**Column widths**: Sorted out the widths of all columns so that the data is clearly visible in all cells.

**Empty rows**: Used the Filter feature to look for blanks and remove all empty rows from the data.

**Duplicate records**: Used Remove Duplicates feature to look for and remove any duplicated records from the data.

**Spelling**: Checked for spelling mistakes in the data and fixed them.

**Whitespace**: Used the Find and Replace feature to remove all double-spaces from the data.

**Department names**: Used Flash Fill to reduce the department names to just one column, and then removed any unnecessary columns.
